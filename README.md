**Gradient Boosting Models**

Gradient Boosting models are powerful machine learning techniques that build an ensemble of decision trees in a sequential manner. Each tree corrects the errors of the previous ones by minimizing a loss function, leading to high predictive accuracy. These models are effective for both regression and classification tasks, handling complex data patterns with robustness to overfitting. Popular implementations include Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), XGBoost, and LightGBM.

**LightGBM**

LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is a highly efficient gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It is designed to be distributed and efficient with faster training speed, lower memory usage, and better accuracy than many other boosting algorithms. LightGBM is particularly well-suited for large datasets and supports parallel and GPU learning.

**XGBoost**

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a scalable and high-performance gradient boosting library. It implements machine learning algorithms under the gradient boosting framework, providing high accuracy and speed. XGBoost is known for its robustness to overfitting, regularization techniques, and support for parallelization, which makes it a popular choice in many competitive machine learning tasks.
